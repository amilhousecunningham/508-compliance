    <!--QUESTION #1 -->
    <h3>Question # 1 - What is 508 Compliance?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> 508 Compliance came about after the Workforce
      Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended in 1998. Section 508 required that
      that electronic technologies, such as websites and other forms of
      multimedia, meet accessibility standards to ensure individuals with
      disabilities have access to digital platforms.

    <h3>Question # 2 - Why is 508 Compliance important?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> 508 Compliance is important because the

      digital platforms. Also, 508 Compliance ensures that individuals,
      companies, and organizations are not sued for violating the Civil Rights
      Act, American Disabilities Act, and other related laws.
